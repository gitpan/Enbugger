=cut




use vars qw( $Caught );
BEGIN {
    no warnings 'once';
    @DB::typeahead = ('$main::Caught = 1','c');

    require 'reset_perms.pl';
}
use Enbugger::OnError;

my $ok = eval {
     die "An exception.\n";
     return 1;
};
isnt( $ok, 'Eval died' );
isnt( $main::Caught, q(Didn't trigger the debugger for the exception) );
