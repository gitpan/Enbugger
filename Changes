  - etc.

  - Applied copyright & license text to all source files
  - Enbugger.pm's compilation is more straightforward
  - Added Emacs formatting declarations to all source files
  - Added notes to non-default debugger hooks that they aren't implemented yet

  - `make clean` deletes Enbugger-*

2.003 Fri Jun 13, 2008

2.005 Thu Nov 13, 2008
