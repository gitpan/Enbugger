NAME
    Enbugger - Turns the debugger on at runtime.

SYNOPSIS
      eval { ... };
      if ( $@ ) {
          # Oops! there was an error! Enable the debugger now!
          require Enbugger;
          $DB::single = 2;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Enables or disables the debugger at runtime regardless of whether your
    process was started with debugging on.

  ENABLING THE DEBUGGER
    The debugger is loaded automatically when Enbugger is loaded. Calling
    "Enbugger->import" also enables single stepping. This is optional but it
    seems like a reasonable default.

      # Installs the debugger.
      require Enbugger;

      # Enables the debugger
      Enbugger->import;

    Or...

      eval 'use Enbugger';

  DISABLING THE DEBUGGER
    Disables single stepping.

      Enbugger->unimport;

    Or...

      eval 'no Enbugger';
